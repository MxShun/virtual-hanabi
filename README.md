Virtual Hanabi is a CG artwork that's visualization of virtual fireworks.

I used to feel to the coming of summers through seeing, hearing and smelling fireworks.
However most of firework events are cancelled this summer due to COVID-19. That makes me so sad.
That's why, I realize fireworks on Web instead of actual one.

To visualize it, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) was pretty effective. It's based on [Processing](https://processing.org/), it muse be the next standard of Web CG.
